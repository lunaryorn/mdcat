## Features

`mdcat` works best with [iTerm2][] or a compatible terminal emulator, and a
good terminal font which includes italic characters.  It supports

* All CommonMark syntax
* Syntax highlighting for code blocks
* Inline links (note the dashed underline like in the screenshot above, in some
  terminals)
* Inline images like in the screenshot above (in some terminals), even from
  HTTP(S) URLs (use `--local` to disable remote images)
* Jump marks for headings (in iTerm2 jump forwards and backwards with
  <key>⇧⌘↓</key> and <key>⇧⌘↑</key>)

| Terminal                |  Basic syntax | Syntax highlighting | Links | Images | Jump marks |
| :---------------------- | :-----------: | :-----------------: | :---: | :----: | :--------: |
| Basic ANSI              | ✓             | ✓                   |       |        |            |
| VTE 0.50 or newer based | ✓             | ✓                   | ✓     |        |            |
| [Terminology][]         | ✓             | ✓                   | ✓     | ✓      |            |
| [iTerm2][]              | ✓             | ✓                   | ✓     | ✓      | ✓          |

## Installation

Install [Rust][rustup] and run `cargo install mdcat`.  To keep mdcat up to date
install [cargo-update][] and run `cargo install-update mdcat`.

### SVG support

`mdcat` needs `rsvg-convert` to show SVG images in [iTerm2][]; otherwise `mdcat`
only shows the image title and URL for SVG images.  Install with `brew install
librsvg`.

[Terminology][] supports SVG out of the box and needs no additional tools.

### 3rd party packages

* [Homebrew][]: `brew install mdcat`
* Arch Linux: [mdcat in AUR][aur]
* Void Linux: `xbps-install -S mdcat`

### Future plans

- [ ] Figure out a better way to show HTML [GH-3](https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/3).
- [ ] CommonMark extensions: Footnotes [GH-1](https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/1).
- [ ] CommonMark extensions: Tables [GH-2](https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/2).
- [ ] Ignore soft wraps and wrap inline text a column limit instead [GH-4](https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/4).
