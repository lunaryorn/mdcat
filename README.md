* In [iTerm2][] and VTE-based terminals: Inline links, with dashed underline like in the screenshot above
* In [iTerm2][]: Inline images like in the screenshot above
* In [iTerm2][]: Jump marks for headings (jump forwards and backwards with
  <key>⇧⌘↓</key> and <key>⇧⌘↑</key>)

Not supported:

* CommonMark extensions: Footnotes and Tables
* Images from remote URLs
* SVG images
* Re-filling paragraphs
