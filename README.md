```
$ mdcat sample.md
```

![mdcat showcase with different colour themes][sxs]

mdcat in [iTerm2], with [Dracula], and [Solarized] Light and Dark (from left to
right), and [PragmataPro] as font.

## Features

`mdcat` works best with [iTerm2] or a compatible terminal emulator, and a good
terminal font with italic characters.  Then it

* nicely renders all basic CommonMark syntax (no [tables][GH-2] or [footnotes][GH-1] though),
* highlights code blocks with [syntect],
* shows [links][osc8] and images inline in supported terminals (see above, where "Pixabay" is a clickable link!),
* adds jump marks for headings in [iTerm2] (jump forwards and backwards with
  <key>⇧⌘↓</key> and <key>⇧⌘↑</key>).

## Installation

### Binaries

The [Releases] page provides pre-build binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows.

**Note:** The Linux build is statically linked and requires the `curl` command
to fetch images from HTTP(S).

**Tip:** You can copy or hard-link `mdcat` to `mdless` for a variant of `mdcat` which paginates by default (like `mdcat -p`).

[Releases]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/releases

### 3rd party packages

Some package repositories include `mdcat`:

* [Homebrew]: `brew install mdcat`
* Arch Linux: `pacman -S mdcat`
* Void Linux: `xbps-install -S mdcat`
* Nixpkgs: `nix-env -i mdcat`

[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh
[aur]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mdcat/

### Building with rustup

You can also build `mdcat` manually with `cargo install mdcat`.

### SVG support

`mdcat` needs `rsvg-convert` to show SVG images in [iTerm2] and [kitty];
otherwise `mdcat` only shows the image title and URL for SVG images.  On macOS
you can install the `librsvg` formula from Homebrew, on Linux the tool is
typically part of the `librsvg-bin` package (or similar).

[Terminology] renders SVG directly and needs no additional tools.

### Future plans

- [ ] Figure out a better way to show HTML [GH-3].
- [ ] CommonMark extensions: Footnotes [GH-1].
- [ ] CommonMark extensions: Tables [GH-2].
- [ ] Ignore soft wraps and wrap inline text a column limit instead [GH-4].
